Title: New York City LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)

Description: The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data has three components: Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI), LODES (this page), and Job-to-job worker flows. The LODES data is further broken down to three pieces:
1. Residential Area Characteristics (RAC) which provides data on where workers live
2. Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC) which provides data on where workers work and some firm level information
3. Origin-Destination (OD) provides the connection between RAC and WAC

NOTE1: each of these datasets includes some demographic and industry data, see the respective data dictionaries for more info

NOTE2: as detailed in the technical document ("LODESTechDoc7.1.pdf") not all fields are available for all years, these include:
+ Race, Ethnicity, Education, and Sex are available 2009-2013 (both RAC and WAC data)
+ Firm Age and Firm Size are available 2011-2013
