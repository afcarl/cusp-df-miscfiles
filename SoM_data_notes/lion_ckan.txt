Both LION and node are tables in the "df_spatial" postgresql database, named "lion_wgs" and "node_wgs" respectively. Both tables' geometries are in WGS84.

Steps taken to bring into the CUSP data facility:
1. Download Esri file geodatabase
2. Convert to shapefiles using ogr2ogr [ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" /target/path/ /path/to/lion.gdb]
3. Use python's geopandas to convert from NY State Plane projection to WGS84
4. Load to postgresql database with [shp2pgsql -s 4326 <dataset>_wgs public.<dataset>_wgs | psql -d df_spatial]
